# RimWorld save game migrator

This repo contains a number of Python scripts to convert RimWorld
saves between different versions.
For more on RimWorld, see the [official site](https://rimworldgame.com) or [/r/RimWorld](https://www.reddit.com/r/RimWorld/).

| Migration   | Supported          | Era |

| A17 to B18  | Built-in to RimWorld B18 | October 2017 |
| [A16 to A17](https://github.com/afit/rimworld-save-migrator/blob/master/upgrade_rws_a16_to_a17.py) | ✅ Fully automated | June 2017 |
| [A15 to A16](https://github.com/afit/rimworld-save-migrator/blob/master/upgrade_rws_a15_to_a16.py)  | ✅ Fully automated | December 2016 |
| A14 to A15  | [Manual guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/RimWorld/comments/4zrotj/guide_how_to_update_an_a14_save_to_a15/) | August 2016 |

In order to run these migrations, you'll first need to create a new saved game using the version you want to migrate to, with the same seed as the save you want to upgrade.

### Caveats

If you are upgrading multiple versions, load and save the migrated game at each stage.

* A16 to A17:
  * Some character backstories have been removed; they will be assigned random ones.
  * Some material stacks will be trimmed to 75.
* A15 to A16:
  * Body types will all be set to male: [more details](http://pastebin.com/HNFFsMBC).
  * You will be asked to name your settlement again.
  * Legacy mood notices referencing characters will refer to them as "{0}".

## Requirements

The scripts work on Windows, macOS and Linux, and require Python 2.7.
Python is pre-installed on macOS and Linux. On Windows, it is available as a [free download](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
Make sure you get the 2.7 version, not the 3.x.

There's a single dependancy that the scripts require: `lxml`.
To install `lxml`, you'll want to run  `pip install lxml` in your Command Prompt or Terminal.
If you already know Python, you'll probably use `virtualenv` for this.

If you have mods installed, you'll want to remove them first, and remove the
references to them from your save.

## Analysing saves

These scripts include `analyse_saves.py`, a handy utility for extracting seeds and playtime from maps.
It will also report on the installed mods, and [where your saves are located](http://rimworldwiki.com/wiki/Save_file).
If you run it, it looks like this:

```bash
$ python analyse_saves.py
Your saves should be at /Users/Guest/Library/Application Support/RimWorld/Saves...
a14_bogdan
 Version:       0.14.1249 rev944
 Seed:          bogdan (200, 150)
 Real playtime: 0:00:24
 Mods:          Core
a15_bogdan
 Version:       0.15.1284 rev141
 Seed:          bogdan (200, 150)
 Real playtime: 0:00:23
 Mods:          Core
a16_bogdan
 Version:       0.16.1393 rev538
 Seed:          bogdan (250, 1, 250)
 Real playtime: 0:00:26
 Mods:          Core
a17_bogdan
 Version:       0.17.1557 rev1154
 Seed:          bodgan (250, 1, 250)
 Real playtime: 0:00:12
 Mods:          Core
```

## Migrating saves

The scripts are simple to run. If you run it without any arguments, it'll tell you how:

```bash
$ python upgrade_rws_a16_to_a17.py
This script will patch your save to A17, saving it as a new file and adding "a17-" to the name. It won't modify your old saves. It requires two arguments:

    python upgrade_rws_a16_to_a17.py [a16-save-to-upgrade] [a17-save-with-same-seed]

- [a16-save-to-upgrade] should be the full path to your saved game.
- [a17-save-with-same-seed] second should be the full path to a fresh A17 saved game,
  generated with the same seed as your A16 game.

Like this:

    python upgrade_rws_a16_to_a17.py /path/to/my-save.rws /path/to/a17-same-seed.rws

## Contributing improvements and reporting problems

Please use the [issues tracker](https://github.com/afit/rimworld-save-migrator/issues)
to report any bugs. Pull requests are gratefully received.

The logic for these scripts came from FMKirby's posts on reddit.

When diagnosing issues, using the game's logs is pretty helpful. On macOS, these
aren't generated by default. To log, use a command like this:

```
$ cd ~/Library/Application\ Support/Steam/steamapps/common/RimWorld/RimWorldMac.app/Contents/MacOS
$ ./RimWorldMac -logfile rimworld.log
```
